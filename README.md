# Credit-card-fraud-detection

This project aims to identify fraudulent transactions in a dataset of credit card transactions. Using machine learning techniques, it seeks to classify transactions as either legitimate or fraudulent, helping to reduce financial losses from fraud.
Project Structure
Data Loading and Exploration: The project begins by loading the dataset, followed by an exploration of its structure and key statistics.
Model Training: A machine learning model is trained on the processed data to predict whether a transaction is fraudulent.
Results and Analysis: The performance of the model is evaluated, with potential insights provided into factors contributing to model accuracy.
Requirements
Libraries: This project requires the following Python libraries:
numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
How to Run
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required libraries (using pip install -r requirements.txt).
Run the Jupyter Notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and view the results.
Future Enhancements
Implement additional algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost) to compare performance.
Explore other evaluation metrics, such as precision, recall, and F1-score, to improve model accuracy.
